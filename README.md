## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 


### Journal

I began this project knowing I wanted to create a dragon-like creature and due to the random multiples of the creature the Laconian Hydra is the natural choice.

16/04
I have started adding the jaw and teeth. The idea with this is the hydra will be able to open and shut it's mouth - I am aiming to have the teeth displace accordingly along the jaw without having to tamper with all of them individualy. I might make the teeth be discrete variables too.

18/04
I have begun to clean up the jaw area so there are less random artifacts hanging around. I have also added in an eyetilt, though it is not entirely working yet. Next I am going to work on adding the rest of the neck, backing for the throat, and some teeth before I move on to the horns and then the colour scheme. After that will just be adding deatails to the face as well as joining each head to necks in the arrangement area.

23/04
I have started editing the arrangment file and discovered that instead of using complicated maths to work out where the shapes need to go I can just find the points on a bezier curve and add detailing with shapes through that method. Next I will be adding teeth, finishing the horns, and working out how to add in a discrete variable or two.

30/04
I discovered a way to use mapping to fill the space of the quads with scales using arcs. I am super happy with the result and I think it's going to be really cool mixed with everything else. I then used the same technique of mapping for the teeth - which I am almost finished - just have to add in some front teeth. I might leave the horns as they are if I run out of time but I will consider adding more detail to them later. After I add in the back of the throat and fix the eyes the face will be done then I can add in special randomness conditions and a discrete variable then just commenting to finish.

01/05
I have finally added a discrete variable in the form of smoke that can be either turned on or off. Hopefully this counts enough. I will make it less common tomorrow when I tackle randomness.
